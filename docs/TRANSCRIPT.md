# Migration Transcript: Porting Skiddle SDK to Modern TypeScript & Node.js

> **Target Audience:** Adam Chandler (Front-End Developer), Chris Seaton (Back-End Team Leader), Neil Meredith (Head of Development) at Skiddle.  
> **Objective:** Document the complete, transparent transcript of steps taken to modernize Skiddle's legacy PHP SDK into a production-grade TypeScript/Node package and Developer Experience CLI.

## Chronological Progress Log

### Step 1: Repository Audit & Legacy Isolation
- **Action:** Audited existing codebase (`skiddle-php-sdk`). Identified core components: `SkiddleSession.php`, `SkiddleRequest.php`, `SkiddleBase.php`, `Events.php`, `Artists.php`, `Venues.php`, and PHPUnit tests.
- **Decision:** Moved all legacy PHP SDK files, tests, and demo scripts into an isolated `/php` directory using `git mv`.
- **Rationale:** Preserves historical git attribution, prevents clutter at the repository root, and maintains legacy reference without breaking past commit history.

### Step 2: Modern JavaScript / TypeScript Toolchain Setup
- **Action:** Established root-level `package.json` with ESM (`"type": "module"`), dual ESM/CJS exports, TypeScript 5.7 configuration, and Vitest test harness.
- **Decision:** Used `tsup` for zero-overhead bundler emitting ESM (`dist/index.js`), CommonJS (`dist/index.cjs`), and TypeScript declaration files (`dist/index.d.ts`).
- **Dependencies:** Selected zero-bloat runtime dependencies: native global `fetch` (Node 18+ and Node 24 support) without Axios or node-fetch bloat; `commander`, `picocolors`, and `prompts` for the developer CLI.

### Step 3: Architecture & Porting of the SDK to TypeScript
- **Action:** Implemented strongly typed, 1:1 functional parity with the original PHP SDK while applying modern async/await patterns:
  - `SkiddleSession`: API key resolution (explicit config or `SKIDDLE_API_KEY` environment variable), debug mode toggling.
  - `SkiddleRequest`: Clean URL construction, API v1 (`https://www.skiddle.com/api/v1`) vs API v3 (`https://api.skiddle.com/v3`) routing, query transformation (`api_key` → `apiKey`), sensitive credential masking in debug logs, unified error handling supporting both API v1 (`errormessage`) and API v3 (`detail`).
  - `SkiddleBase`: Fluent query condition builder (`addCond`, `delCond`, `clearCond`), automatic uppercasing of the `eventCode` API quirk, and backward-compatible `formatForLog`.
  - `Events`: Implements v3 instant-search (`getListings`) and v1 single-event retrieval (`getListing`).
  - `Artists` & `Venues`: Listing lookups with typed responses.
  - `createClient`: Ergonomic factory function for instant consumption.

### Step 4: Verification & Automated Test Suite
- **Action:** Authored comprehensive unit & integration tests in `tests/sdk.test.ts` covering:
  - Authentication resolution and failure states.
  - API v1 and v3 endpoint generation and key transformation.
  - Error decoding from failed API responses.
  - Fluent condition chaining and removal.
  - Debug credential sanitization.
- **Result:** 14/14 tests passing in Vitest under 400ms.

### Step 5: "NX° Developer Experience" CLI (`/cli`)
- **Action:** Built a specialized CLI toolkit in `/cli` executable as `nx` or `skiddle-nx` (`npm run cli`).
- **Features Included:**
  - `doctor`: Validates local environment, checks API key presence, pings API v1 and v3 endpoints, and reports latency.
  - `events [keyword]`: Searches events directly from terminal with formatted pricing, dates, and ticket status.
  - `event <id>`: Inspects detailed payload of a single event.
  - `scenarios [id]`: Executes the 10 classic test scenarios originally written in PHP `loadTest.php`.
  - `benchmark`: Concurrently measures throughput (req/s), average latency, and p50/p95/p99 percentiles.
  - `interactive`: Terminal UI menu for interactive developer exploration.

### Step 6: Interview Discussion Guide & Architectural Rationale
- **Action:** Created tailored talking points and interview answers addressing Agenda Item 3 (*"Discuss the code you supplied and the rationale behind the decisions you made"*) and Item 4 (*"Questions based on the role and how you handle certain situations"*).
